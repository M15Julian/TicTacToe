# Tic Tac Toe

This little project is my first project I made with C# WPF. It includes two game modes: "Player vs Player" where you can play against a friend and "Player vs Computer" where you can face off against an unbeatable AI.

My code isn't clean as I'm still a beginner.

## Description

If you change the game mode, it won't change until the next round.

## Installation

You can either download the project and open it in Visual Studio or just download the compiled version from TicTacToe/bin/Debug/
